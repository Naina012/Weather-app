## Functionality

`Celsius and Fahrenheit Toggle`
You can easily switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units to view the temperature in your preferred metric. The toggle switch allows you to seamlessly switch between the two temperature scales, making it convenient for users worldwide.

`Autocomplete Search`
Enhancing the search input with autocomplete suggestions makes finding locations quick and effortless. As you type, the app will provide location suggestions based on your input. This feature utilizes the Location Lookup API, allowing you to get accurate and relevant suggestions.
